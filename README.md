# ResNet-Generator-for-digits
A script for generating ResNet model which is proposed by MSRA in ImageNet 2015.

Original paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1.pdf

Generated model is exactly same as https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks, with initialization parameters. 

Can be used in digits for training.
